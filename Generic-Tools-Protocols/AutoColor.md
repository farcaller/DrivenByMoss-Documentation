# Auto Color

This extensions allows to automatically assign a color to your tracks based on the tracks' name. 

## Installation

The *Auto Color* extension needs to be added manually. Open the controller settings and click on *Add controller*, select *Utilities*, and then *Auto Color* from the list.

## Usage

The first parameter allows to turn auto-coloring on and off.

Below that there is a search string for each color. E.g. if you write *Bass* in the text field *Red*, all tracks, which contain the word *Bass* in their name will automatically be colored in red. For multiple search strings use a comma, e.g. I put "Drum,BD,Snare,HiHat,Crash" after blue to auto color all drum related tracks.
